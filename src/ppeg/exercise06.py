# Exercise #6: Ordinal Suffix
"""In English, ordinal numerals have suffixes such as the “th” in “30th” or 
“nd” in “2nd”. Write an `ordinal_suffix()` function with an integer parameter 
named `number` and returns a string of the number with its ordinal suffix. 
For example, `ordinal_suffix(42)` should return the string '42nd'.
